# Git Emergency Service

# DELETE BRANCH
### # Delete a local GIT branch:
#### - Soft
    git branch -d <branchname>
#### - Force
    git branch -D <branchname>
    - or
    git branch -d --force <branchname>
    - or
    git branch --delete --force <branchname>

### # Delete a remote GIT branch:
    git push origin --delete <branchname>
    
# PUSH BRANCH
### # Push a new local branch to a remote Git repository and track it too
    git push -u origin <branchname>
    
# RENAME BRANCH
### # Rename a Branch
    git branch -m <oldbranchname> <newbranchname>

# RECOVER
### # Recover a deleted file in local repo 
#### - If the deletion has not been committed, the command below will restore the deleted file in the working tree.
    git checkout -- <filename>
#### - You can get a list of all the deleted files in the working tree using the command below.
    git ls-files --deleted

#### - If the deletion has been committed, find the commit where it happened, then recover the file from this commit.
    git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file>
    git checkout <commit>^ -- <file>

#### - In case you are looking for the path of the file to recover, the following command will display a summary of all deleted files.
    git log --diff-filter=D --summary

# RESET
### # To revert changes made to the index (i.e., that you have added), do this. Warning this will reset all of your unpushed commits to master!:
    git reset
    git reset --hard

### # To revert a change that you have committed:
    git revert <commit 1> <commit 2>
    
### # To remove untracked files (e.g., new files, generated files):
    git clean -f
    
### # Or untracked directories (e.g., new or automatically generated directories):
    git clean -fd

### # Re-clone
    GIT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
    cd $GIT/..
    rm -rf $GIT
    git clone ...
